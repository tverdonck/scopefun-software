#
# Notes:
#
# Remove all of the tags below except for the last one when creating new
# development branch.
#
# Once a symbol has been included in a stable release of wxWidgets its version
# cannot be changed.
#
# With each new release a section should be added containing any new symbols,
# for example:
#
#   # public symbols added in release @WX_VERSION_TAG@.2 (please keep in alphabetical order):
#   @WX_VERSION_TAG@.2 extern "C++" {
#           "wxChoice::GetCurrentSelection() const";
#   };
#
# If a symbols should have been added in this way, but is forgotten then it
# cannot be added in the next release. This is because it has already been
# released with the generic branch version due to the final wildcard below,
# and once released its version cannot be changed.


# public symbols added in 3.0.5 (please keep in alphabetical order):
@WX_VERSION_TAG@.5 {
    extern "C++" {
        "wxSVGFileDCImpl::DoDrawPolyPolygon(int, int const*, wxPoint const*, int, int, wxPolygonFillMode)";
        "wxSVGFileDCImpl::SetAxisOrientation(bool, bool)";
        "wxSVGFileDCImpl::SetDeviceOrigin(int, int)";
        "wxSVGFileDCImpl::SetLogicalOrigin(int, int)";
        "wxWindow::GetContentScaleFactor() const";
    };
};

# public symbols added in 3.0.4 (please keep in alphabetical order):
@WX_VERSION_TAG@.4 {
    extern "C++" {
        "wxDirButton::DoApplyWidgetStyle(_GtkRcStyle*)";
        "wxFileButton::DoApplyWidgetStyle(_GtkRcStyle*)";
        "wxRibbonPage::ShowScrollButtons1()";
        "wxWindow::GTKApplyCssStyle(char const*)";
    };
};

# public symbols added in 3.0.3 (please keep in alphabetical order):
@WX_VERSION_TAG@.3 {
    extern "C++" {
        "wxDataViewRenderer::FinishEditing()";
        "wxFloatProperty::DoGetAttribute(wxString const&) const";
    };
};

# public symbols added in 3.0.2 (please keep in alphabetical order):
@WX_VERSION_TAG@.2 {
    extern "C++" {
        "wxGenericListCtrl::EndEditLabel(bool)";
    };
};


# public symbols added in 3.0.1 (please keep in alphabetical order):
@WX_VERSION_TAG@.1 {
    extern "C++" {
        "wxDataViewListCtrl::ClearColumns()";
        "wxDataViewListStore::ClearColumns()";
        "wxInfoBarGeneric::SetForegroundColour(wxColour const&)";
        "wxTDIChildFrame::DoMoveWindow(int, int, int, int)";
    };
};

# symbols available since the beginning of this branch are only given
# generic branch tag (don't remove this!):

@WX_VERSION_TAG@ {
        *;
};
